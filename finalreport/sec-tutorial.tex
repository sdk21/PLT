\section{Basics and syntax}

A \QL file (extension \texttt{.ql} by convention) comprises several functions, each of them having its own variables. Once compiled, a program will start by calling the \textsf{compute()} function that must appear in the \texttt{.ql} file, and whose prototype is as follows:
\begin{lstlisting}
def compute(int a): int trial {
  # do some stuff, call some other functions
}
\end{lstlisting}
In particular, the main entry point \textsf{compute()} receives an integer argument, \textsf{a}, and returns an integer value, \textsf{type}.
Note also that \QL is case-sensitive: \textsf{compute} and \textsf{Compute} would be two different functions (however, indentation is completely unrestricted).

As hinted above, comments in the language are single-line, and start with a \#: everything following this symbol, until the next line return, will be ignored by the compiler. Furthermore, a function is defined (and declared -- there is no forward declaration) by the keyword \textsf{def} followed by the details of the function:
\begin{lstlisting}
def function_name(type1 param1, type2 param2, ..., typek paramk): type returnvar {
  # variable declarations
  # body of the function
}
\end{lstlisting}
The valid types  in \QL for parameters, return variables and variables are \texttt{int}, \texttt{float}, \texttt{comp}, \texttt{mat}: respectively integers, real numbers, complex numbers and matrices (the latter including, as we shall see, qubits). In the above, the return variable \textsf{returnvar} is available in the body of the function, and its value will be returned at the end of the function call. All other local variables must be declared, one by line, at the beginning of the function body: in particular, it is not possible to mix variable declaration and assignment:
\begin{lstlisting}
def foo( mat bar ): mat blah {
  int bleh;                       # OK
  int bluh = 0;                   # Not OK: parsing error
  comp blih, bloh;                # Not OK: one variable at a time
  bleh = 5;                       # OK
  bleh = bleh+1                   # Not OK: missing semicolon
  bleh = bleh * 4 +
         2^bleh;                  # OK: statements can span several lines
  bleh = bleh-1; bleh = 2*bleh;   # OK: several statements per line
  blah = bleh * bar;              # OK: blah is the returned variable
}
\end{lstlisting}
As examplified above, each statement (declaration, assignment, operation) can span any number of lines, and end with a semicolon.

\section{Control structures, built-in functions and conversions}
Now that the basic syntax of the language has been described, it is time to have a look at the fundamental blocks of any algorithm: the control structures, such as loops and conditional statements. 

\paragraph{Loops.} \QL supports two sorts of loop, the \textsf{for} and \textsf{while} statements. While their bahavior is illustrated below, it is important to remember two features of the \textsf{for} loop: namely, that \textsf{(a)} the loop index must be a variable declared beforehand; and \textsf{(b)} that the (mandatory) keyword \textsf{by} allows to set the increment size by any integer, even negative.

\begin{lstlisting}
 int i; # Will be used as 'for' loop index
 int a;

 for( i from 0 to 2 by 1 ) # OK
   a=a+5;

 for( i from 2 to 0 by -1 ) # OK
 {
     a=a*10;
     continue; # going to next iteration: the next instruction will never be executed.
     print(a);
 }
 
 for( i from 1 to 10 ) # Not OK: missing "by"
 {
     a=a-3;
     break; # For the sake of the example: leaves the loop.
 }
 
 while( a leq 10 ) # OK
 a=a+1;
 
 while( a neq 0 )  # OK
 {
     a = (a+1) % 42;
     continue;
     print(0); # never reached
 }
\end{lstlisting}
As shown above, braces are optional when the body of the loop comprises only one line.

\paragraph{Conditional constructs.} As in many languages, \QL supports a C-like \textsf{if}\dots\textsf{else} construct:
\begin{lstlisting}
       if( predicate )
       {
          # Do something
       }
       else
       {
          # Do something else
       }
\end{lstlisting}
The predicate can be any expressio evaluating to an integer: if non-zero, the \textsf{if} statement is entered; otherwise, the (optional) \textsf{else} statement is entered, if it exists. Note that \QL does not provide a builtin construct \textsf{elseif}, but instead relies on a nested combination of \textsf{if} and \textsf{else}:
\begin{lstlisting}
 if(z eq 5) a = 0;
       
 a = a - 2;
 if( z leq 5 )
 {
    a = 0;
 }
 else
 {
    a = 10;
    b = 24;
 }
       
 if( a gt 100 )
 {
    print(b); # a > 100
 }
 else if( a eq 10 )
 {
    print(a);
 }
\end{lstlisting}

\paragraph{Builtin functions and operators.} As shown in the previous two examples, \QL provides builtin constructs to perform basic or fundamental tasks:
\begin{description}
  \item[\rm\em Logical operators:] \textsf{gt}, \textsf{lt}, \textsf{geq}, \textsf{leq}, \textsf{eq}, \textsf{neq} take two operands $a$, $b$, and return 0 (resp. 1) if respectively $a > b$, $a < b$, $a \geq b$, $a \leq b$, $a \leq b$ and $a = b$ and $a \neq b$;
  \item[\rm\em Builtin functions:] \todonote{fill in}
  \item[\rm\em Operators:] \todonote{fill in}
  \item[\rm\em Constants:] \todonote{fill in}
\end{description}

\paragraph{Implicit conversions.} 
Implicit conversions for some operators such as \textsf{eq} is possible, according to the following rule: \texttt{int}$\leadsto$\texttt{float}$\leadsto$\texttt{comp}$\leadsto$\texttt{mat}. However, the language is otherwise strongly typed: it is not possible to assign a complex number to a variable of type $\texttt{mat}$, for instance.

\section{Diving in: Deutsch--Jozsa Algorithm}

To illustrate and describe the process of writing in \QL, this section will walk the reader through the implementation of one of the most emblematic quantum examples, namely \emph{Deutsch-Jozsa Algorithm}. The goal of this algorithm is to answer the following question: given query access to an unknown fucntion $f\colon\{0,1\}^n \to \{0,1\}$, promised to be either constant or balanced\footnote{$f$ is said to be balanced if $f(x)=0$ for exactly half of the inputs $x\in\{0,1\}^n$; or, equivalently, if $\shortexpect_{x}[f(x)] = \frac{1}{2}$.}, which of the two holds?  Classically, it is easy to see that this requires (in the worst case) querying just over half the solution space, that is $2^{n-1} + 1$ queries.  Quantumly, the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm enables us to answer this question with just \emph{one} query!\medskip

\noindent The circuit performing the algorithm is given below:
\begin{align*}
 \Qcircuit @C=1em @R=.7em {
  \lstick{\ket{0}} & /^n \qw & \gate{H^{\otimes n}} & \multigate{1}{U_f} & \gate{H^{\otimes n}}	& \meter & \cw \\
  \lstick{\ket{1}} & \qw     & \gate{H}             & \ghost{U_f}        & \qw
 }
\end{align*}

To implement it in \QL, we first have to implement the $n$-fold Hadamard gate $H^{\otimes n}$; recalling that the Hadamard gate $H$ is a built-in operator of the language, this can be done as follows:\todonote{Check the QL code for Deutsch-Jozsa -- there were typos and mistakes in the .ql file.}
\begin{lstlisting}
  def hadamard(int n): mat gate{
        #returns Hadamard gate of 2^n dimensions
        gate = H; 
        for(i from 1 to n by 1){
                gate = gate @ H;                 
        }       
}
\end{lstlisting}
Now, to implement the measurement gate (or, more precisely, to return the measurement matrix), we write the following code that takes a ket $\ket{x}$ and returns the matrix $\ket{x}\bra{x}$:
\begin{lstlisting}
def measure(qubk top): mat result{
        # returns the measurement matrix  
        mat adjoint = Adj(top);
        result = top * adjoint;
}
\end{lstlisting}
(Note that $\ket{x}\bra{x}$ was written as $\ket{x}\operatorname{adjoint}(\ket{x})$, which is performed above using the transparent conversion between vectors and matrices provided by the language.)\medskip

Once all the ``building blocks'' (gates) of the algorithm have been implemented, we can write down the algorithm \emph{as it appears from the circuit above}: the function takes as argument a qubit \textsf{top} (in the diagram, $\ket{0}$), the parameter size $n$, as well as the unitary matrix implementing the quantum  gate $U_f$ (the access to the unknown function $f$), and returnings either 0 or 1, dependeing one wether the function is constant or balanced.
\begin{lstlisting}
def deutsch(int n, qubk top, mat U): int outcomeZero{       
        qubk bottom;  # originally, the |1> qubit    
        mat input; # input will be the tensor product of top and bottom register  
        mat had;   # n-fold Hadamard gate  
        mat meas;

        bottom = |1>;
        input = top @ bottom;
        had = hadamard(n);
        input = had * input;
        
        input = U*input;
        input = (H @ I)*input;
        
        meas = measure (top);        
        input = ((meas@I)*input;
        
        input = norm(input);
        
        if (eq(input,0)){
                outcomeZero = 0;
        }
        else{
                outcomeZero = 1;
        }
}
\end{lstlisting}

Finally, we can call (and test) our algorithm by defining two unitary transformations (here $U_b$ and $U_c$) and testing our function on them -- and print the output. This is done by writing the entry point function, \textsf{compute}:
\begin{lstlisting}
def compute (): int outcome{
        qubk top;
        mat Ub;
        mat Uc;
        int n;
        
        n = 1;
        top = |0>;
        Ub = [(1,0,0,0)(0,1,0,0)(0,0,0,1)(0,0,1,0)];
        Uc = [(1,0,0,0)(0,1,0,0)(0,0,1,0)(0,0,0,1)]; # identity

        outcome = deutsch (2,top, Ub);
        print(outcome);
        outcome = deutsch (2,top, Uc);
        print(outcome);
}
\end{lstlisting}
