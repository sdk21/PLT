Name bindings have a block scope. That is to say, the scope of a name binding
is limited to a section of code that is grouped together. That name can only be
used to refer to associated entity in that block of code. Blocks of code in
QLang are deliminated by the opening curly brace ('\{') at the start of the
block, and the closing curly brace ('\}') at the end of the block. 

Within a program, variables may be declared and/or defined  in various places. The scope of each variable is different, depending on where it is declared.There are three primary scope rules.

If a variable is defined at the outset/outer block of a program, it is visible everywhere in the program.

If a variable is defined as a parameter to a function, or inside a function/block of code, it is visible only within that function.

Declarations made after a specific declaration are not visible to it, or to any declarations before it.

For instance, consider the following snippet.

\begin{lstlisting}

int x = 5;

int y = x + 10;  # this works

int z = a + 100;  # this does not

int a = 200; 
\end{lstlisting}
