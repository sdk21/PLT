I learned many lessons from this project, most of which were related to group dynamics. I learned that, depending on how they are managed and leveraged, every group member's differences (i.e. differences in ideas, opinions, abilities, etc.) can either be beneficial or detrimental to the group and the project. In order to effectively leverage differences in opinion, all group member's opinions should be heard and considered by the group, and if a clear winner does not emerge the leader for that part of the project should make a decisive decision. This situation highlights another aspect of group dynamics that I learned - leaders are important. In order to keep the different parts of the project focused and progressing, each part should have a group member that leads its development. Leading the development of a part of the project entails having expertise in the associated domain, resolving tough issues and questions with it, and driving its development from beginning to end.In addition to the lessons I learned involving group dynamics, I also learned lessons, and re-learned lessons that I should have already known, that apply to project work in general. Among these lessons learned were: start early and manager your time well, thoroughly research ideas before you begin implementing them, and maintain a big picture view of the project.
