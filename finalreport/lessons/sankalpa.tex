I realized that one of the important aspects of doing a big project is to make incremental progress, however small, over time. In the beginning, it is not always possible to have a global view of how each component of project fits in together. This can be discouraging factor at times, however this should not deter anyone from building the components of the project. Teamwork is very crucial to the success of the project. From the very beginning of the project, it is important to delegate responsibilities and making sure that each member of team is contributing to the project. Any disruption to this can affect the work balance.

Finally, it is a very fulfilling experience to design a programming language from CS perspective. This experience draws from both theory and application aspect of CS. Everyone doing similar projects in future should try to participate, contribute and enjoy the process.
