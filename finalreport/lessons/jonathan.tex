At the start of the semester, the task of creating a new programming language seemed to be an impossibility. However, over the course of the semester, I learned and a gained an appreciation for the amount of work and though that goes into the creation of languages.

I have learned that communication is key. Without our regular meetings, I would have been floundering whenever I was off working independently. It is necessary to have a clear picture of what is needed to be done everytime you sit down to work on the project. Effective communication also allowed us to flesh out the gritty details of the language. What could have been improved is how quickly a concensus on specifics could be reached. It would have been better to have one person decide on these things and work could have been started immediatedly.

I know this is probably a common sentiment, but starting this project early is key. We did not really start pushing until the start of November. Ideally, once we covered the lectures on the structure of the compiler we should have hit the ground running. I have also learned that even though git can be great at what it does, improper use of it can lead to a great deal of frustration if one pushes bad code, or someone else deletes good working code.
