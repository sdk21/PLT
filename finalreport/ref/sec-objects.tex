\subsection{Objects and lvalues}
As in C, ``an object is a manipulatable region of storage; an lvalue is an expression referring to an object.''

\subsection{Valid types}

The language features 4 elementary types, namely \integ, \float, \complex, \mat. Is also valid, any type that inductively can be built from a valid type as follows:
\begin{itemize}
  \item elementary types are valid;
  \item an \emph{matrix} of a valid type is valid. Matrices have fixed size (that must be declared at compilation time), and are comprised of any elements of any type (that is, a matrix can have elements of non-necessarily identical types);
  \item a \emph{function} taking as input a fixed number of elements from (non-necessarily identical) valid types, and returning a valid type.
\end{itemize}
