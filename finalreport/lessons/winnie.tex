I learned that one should always work while keeping in the mind the shape of the end result. That helps in making sure your efforts are not wasted, and helps you make decisions more easily. Also, start early. And always test every change as you go. If you code everything at once and then it doesn't work, it gets very hard to debug.

Also, since we were using git as our version control system, we had to deal with numerous merge conflicts. So I learnt that one should keep committing changes, as you code as soon as you can be sure however much you have written is correct, no matter how small the change. this helps makes sure you are not causing any faults or conflicts for the other team members and also for you as an individual.
