This directory contains C++ files that seek to address the three example
problems described in section 10.1 of the QLang Language Reference 
Manual.

Before you compile, you must have the Eigen matrix library installed on
your computer. Currently, the Makefile assumes that the Eigen directory 
is located in /usr/include/eigen3. If your library is installed elsewhere
be sure to change line 4 (INCLUDES) to point to the Eigen directory. 

To compile all three programs type 'make', or you can compile each 
program separately by entering 'make #' where # is the number of the 
program you wish to compile.

............TODO............
Would like to implement a tensor product function that will take any size
matrix/vector.


PART 3 IS CURRENTLY BROKEN
