\subsection{Literals}
Literals are integers, floats, complex numbers, qubits, and matrices, as well as the built-in constants of the language (e.g. \textsf{pi}). Integers are of type \integ, floats are of type \float, complex numbers are of type \complex, qubits and matrices are of type \mat. The built-in constants have pre-determined types described above (e.g. \textsf{pi} is of type \float).

The remaining major subsections of this section describe the groups of \textit{expression} operators, while the minor subsections describe the individual operators within a group.
\subsection{Primary Expressions}
\subsubsection{identifier}
Identifiers are primary expression. All identifiers have an associated type that is given to them upon declaration (e.g. \float \textit{ident} declares an identifier named ident that is of type \float).
\subsubsection{literals}
Literals are primary expression. They are described above.

\subsubsection{(\textit{expression})}
Parenthesized expressions are primary expressions. The type and value of a parenthesized expression is the same as the type and value of the expression without parenthesis. Parentheses allow expressions to be evaluated in a desired precedence. Parenthesized expressions are evaluated relative to each other starting with the expression that is nested the most deeply and ending with the expression that is nested the least deeply (i.e. the shallowest).

\subsubsection{\textit{primary-expression}(\textit{expression-list})}
Primary expressions followed by a parenthesized expression list are primary expressions. Such primary expressions can be used in the declaration of functions or function calls. The expression list must consist of one or more expressions separated by commas. If being used in function declarations, they must be preceded by the correct function declaration syntax and each \textit{expression} in the expression list must evaluate to a type followed by an identifier. If being used in function calls each \textit{expression} in the expression list must evaluate to an identifier.

\subsubsection{\textit{primary-expression}[\textit{expression-list}]}
Primary expressions followed by a bracketed expression list are primary expressions. Such primary expressions can be used in the declaration of matrices and arrays or to access an element of a matrix or array. The expression list must consist of one (for matrices and arrays) or two (for matrices) expressions separated by commas, and must evaluate to \integ.

\subsubsection{[\textit{expression}-elementlist]}
Expression element lists in brackets are primary expressions. Such primary expressions are used to define matrices and therefore are of type \mat. The expression element list must consist of one or more expressions separated by commas or parenthsized. Commas separate expressions into matrix columns and parentheses group expressions into matrix rows. The expressions must evaluate to the same type and can be of type \integ, \float, \complex, or \mat. Additionally, the number of expressions in each row of the matrix must be the same. An example matrix is shown below.

\begin{lstlisting}
int a = 3;
int b = 12;
mat my_matrix = [ (0+1, 2, a)( 5-1, 2*3-1, 12/2)];
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection{<\textit{expression}|}
Expressions with a less than sign on the left and a bar on the right are primary expression. Such expressions are used to define qubits and therefore are of type \mat. The notation is meant to mimic the "bra-" of "bra-ket" notation and can therefore be thought of as a row vector representation of the given qubit. Following "bra-ket" notation, the expression must evaluate  to an integer literal of only 0's and 1's, which represents the state of the qubit. An example "bra-" qubit is shown below.

\begin{lstlisting}
mat b_qubit = <0100|;
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection{|\textit{expression}>}
Expressions with a bar on the left and a greater than sign on the right are primary expression. All of the considerations are the same as for <\textit{expression}|, except that this notation mimics the "ket" of "bra-ket" notation and can therefore be though of as a column vector representation of the given qubit. An example "ket-" qubit is shown below.

\begin{lstlisting}
int a = 001;
mat k_qubit = |a>;
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection{norm \textit{expression}}
The result is the norm of the \textit{expression}. The type of the expression must be \mat, \complex, or \float. The result has type \float, and corresponds to the $2$-norm; in the case of \complex or \float, this coincides with respectively the module and absolute value.

Integer division is rounded towards 0 and truncated. \new{(If an error occured because of a division by zero, a runtime exception is raised.)}
\subsubsection{\textit{expression} \% \textit{expression}}
The result is the remainder of the division of the \textit{expressions}, where the first \textit{expression} is the dividend and the second is the divisor. The sign of the dividend and the divisor are ignored, so the result returned is always the remainder of the absolute value (or module) of the dividend divided by the absolute value of the divisor.
