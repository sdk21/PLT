QLang
======

A language to help emulate and play with quantum computing algorithms!

This project contains the following folders:

1. Compiler :


This has our code files for the compiler.
It has our compiler code as well the support for being able to execute the generated C++ code files. 

The folders contained within this folder are :
 
 a. cpp : for the cpp support files.
 b. includes : for the included Eigen library.
 c. test : contains the test files and scripts. More information is provided in the report.

If you need to write you own Qlang program, 

   - save it as a file with no extension.
   - run 'sh qlc.sh <yourfilename>' to create the executable for your program.
   - next, run the executable to get your output, like './<yourfilenameagain>'. 


2. Demo :

This folder houses our implementations of some quantum computing circuits in QLang.


3. finalreport :

This has the source and generated tex files for the project report. The final generated pdf is present irectly in the project folder as finalReport.pdf. 

4. reference :

This folder is for more tex files referred by the final report.

5. Resources : 

This folder houses all our references material and the past year projects that we looked at.
We would like to have these projects considered as implicit citations.
